Question : What is Dimension reduction ?

Dimensionality reduction is the reduction in the number of dimension of input variables used to train the model.
So to sum up, the idea of dimension reduction is simple — reduce the number of variables of a data set, while 
preserving as much information as possible. One of the popular dimensionality reduction technique is PCA(Principle Component Analysis).
Before applying dimensionality reduction one thing is very important i.e Standardization, because the variable with large range(ex 0-100)
dominate over variable with small range(ex 0-1).

Advantages of Dimension reduction :
-> Easier to Explore and visualize the Data.
-> Making Computation Faster for MAchine learning algorithm.
-> Remove redundant features.
-> Take less storage space.

Disadvantages of Dimension reduction :

->Loss of data, sometime which lead to bad accuracy.
->Some time the linear correlation between variable are undesirable.
